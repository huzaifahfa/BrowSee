# BrowSee
This project is for Hack For Hope 2025, an online hackathon to create accessible software that aims to help make the lives of visually impaired people easier and more efficient. I have to honestly say that there are still errors with this project, so it is not yet completed.

### **Overview**  
For this project, it was inspired by the ideas given by people on the r/Blind subreddit, as well as my own experience with using Facebook Marketplace. Screen readers and image descriptions help people with visual impairment navigate the Internet, and as a seller on Facebook Marketplace, I thought that a tool to help connect blind and visually impaired users with Facebook Marketplace listings will help them to browse the catalog in a more accessible way. This Chrome extension enhances accessibility for visually impaired users by providing AI-generated image descriptions for product listings on Facebook Marketplace. The extension utilizes the OpenAI Vision API to analyze images and generate meaningful descriptions, improving the online shopping experience for those who rely on screen readers.  

### **Features (at least what I planned)**  
These are the features I planned for this project:
- AI-powered image recognition using OpenAI Vision API
- Seamless integration with Facebook Marketplace
- Screen-reader-friendly output for better accessibility
- Lightweight and easy-to-use Chrome extension

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI Vision API  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huzaifahfa/BrowSee.git
   cd BrowSee
   ```  
2. Open **Google Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.  
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right corner).  
4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the project folder.  
5. The extension will now be installed and ready for use.  

It's barely usable, but the frontend works so that's a win for me :D

### **Challenges & Learnings**  
This is my first solo hackathon (usually I hack with my friends), and it highlighted a lot of my own weaknesses as well as my strengths. This is my first unfinished hackathon project (sad), but I learned a lot of frontend skills (yeay). I'm just glad that the frontend actually works because I really thought the extension wouldn't even appear on Facebook Marketplace. I also realized my backend skills suck (I need to improve on JavaScript tbh), so overall I'm not really sad about doing this project since I learned a lot, plus it helps me realize how inacessible a lot of apps are for visually impaired and blind people. Thank you to the organizers for this opportunity to hack and learn!
